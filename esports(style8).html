                <h1>I believe esports will rival the biggest traditional sports leagues in terms of future opportunities, and between advertising, ticket sales, licensing, sponsorships and merchandising, there are tremendous growth areas for this nascent industry –Steve Borenstein, Chairman of Activision Blizzard’s Esports Division and Former CEO of ESPN and NFL Network</h1>
                <p class="para">Esports is a booming global industry where skilled video gamers play competitively. In the same way that traditional sports have competitions in baseball, basketball, and football, esports encompasses competitions across a variety of video games. Contrary to common perception, esports is not simply a phenomenon occurring in the basements of unemployed twentysomethings; the industry is real, growing globally, and investable. In fact, over 380 million people watch esports worldwide both online and in person. More people watched the 2016 world finals of popular esports game League of Legends (43 million viewers) than the NBA Finals Game 7 that year (31 million viewers). With its fragmented landscape and digital platform, the esports sector holds promise for a multitude of monetization opportunities.

                    The following article will include an introduction to the industry as well as insights for those interested in investing in it. It will answer the question “what is esports gaming?” and cover the parties involved in esports, the size and demographics of the audience, the industry dynamics, and how to approach investing in the space. I will provide not only third-party data and analysis, but also my personal experience and insight after listening to people, learning about the industry, and launching an esports company myself </p>
